# mychat-client
Socket IO client side test application

run `yarn` to install dependencies
run `yarn start` to start the react app

This connects to a locally running instance of mychat-server. In order to test on
multiple machines in a given network, change `socketUrl` (App.js : 11) from
localhost to your local IP address. All other devices must be on the same wifi network.
